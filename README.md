This repo provides the elements to build a Vagrant box based on CentOS 7.2 with rvm and node pre-installed. And the virtualbox guest extensions actually work!

The codebase is based on the CentOS 7.2 bento packer scripts with some modifications.

To build this Vagrant image, run packer build packer.json and wait patiently.
